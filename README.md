# LearningPython
This is the naive works to CS902: Programming Ideas and Methods(Python)

## Project: The Three-body Problem
This is a naive try to tkinter and Python in my sophomore year.
I made this program in 3 days(I think), so there's no collision detecting.
No rendering, no 3d and buggy.
Now I can make better ones with C++ and OpenGL! :)
